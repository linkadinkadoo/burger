# Eat-Da-Burger

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Submit a burger's name, and it will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When you user click it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

# Have Fun!
